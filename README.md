#### Overview of Master Data Cleaning

Master Data Cleaning in Excel ensures that your dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. It is a crucial first step in any data workflow to prevent errors in reports or dashboards. Clean data forms the foundation for reliable insights.

► Ensures data integrity and reliability

► Reduces errors in analysis and reporting

► Prepares data for visualization and modeling

#### Common Data Cleaning Tasks

Data cleaning typically involves identifying and fixing inconsistencies across the dataset. The image demonstrates practical Excel techniques to handle messy data.

► Removing duplicates to maintain unique records

► Correcting inconsistent text values (e.g., “NY” vs “New York”)

► Trimming extra spaces and non-printable characters

► Standardizing numeric and date formats

#### Excel Tools and Features

Excel offers multiple built-in tools and functions to simplify the cleaning process. These tools make it easier to automate repetitive tasks and maintain a structured dataset.
